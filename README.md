# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`npm start`
`npm test`
`npm run build`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Questions:
- ALL transaction data means internal also?

Add later:
- I used etherscan which is blockchain explorer to avoid off-chain indexing by each block
- I didn't added redux bla bla bal
- Check transactionsUnionByHash implementation

TODO for future:
- Add paging in while loop for etherscan API call
- Add Erc721 Token Txns (for example uniswap v3)
